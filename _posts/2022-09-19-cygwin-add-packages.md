# Install Additional Packages in Cygwin
To add additional packages to Cygwin, you will need to run the file that you initially used to install Cygwin.

1. Open the <code>setup-x86.exe</code> (32 bit) or <code>setup-x86_64.exe</code> (64 bit) file, depending on which you downloaded.
2. Follow the prompts. You'll be asked to choose:
	- Your download source
	- A root directory (where your installation of Cygwin lives)
	- A local package directory (where any downloaded packages should live)
	- Your internet connection method
	- A download site
3. When prompted, select packages by using the drop-down menus to choose your desired version for each one.
4. If you're having trouble finding the packages you want, from the <code>View</code> drop-down menu, select <code>Full</code>.
5. Cygwin may try to install other updates. From the <code>View</code> drop-down, select <code>Pending</code> to see all the packages that will be installed or updated. Use the drop-down menus to choose which ones to skip, keep, etc.
6. Follow the prompts to finish the installation.
