<p>When recording audiobook chapters for LibriVox, I have a system for naming and working on the audio files I’ve recorded in Audacity.</p>

<p>When I first do my recording, I name the first AUP file something like this:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">booktitle_section#_authorlastname_128kb-raw.aup</code></p>

<p>I replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">booktitle</code> with the title of the work, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">section#</code> with the chapter or section number (e.g, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">02</code> for chapter two), and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authorlastname</code> with the last name of the author. The word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raw</code> indicates a recording I haven’t touched or edited in any way. I keep the raw version as a backup in case I make a mistake in the working file.</p>

<p>When I’m ready to start editing my recording, I save a copy of the original file with a new name:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">booktitle_section#_authorlastname_128kb-working.aup</code></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">working</code> part indicates that this is the AUP file I’m editing. This is where I trim long pauses, re-record bad sections, and basically clean things up.</p>

<p>When I’m happy with the recording and ready to run some final effects to polish it up, I save a new copy of the edited file:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">booktitle_section#_authorlastname_128kb-polished.aup</code></p>

<p>I apply the final effects to this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polished</code> file, such as amplifying or de-amplifying, compressing, normalizing, etc. I do these steps in a separate file in case a LibriVox proof listener finds mistakes and asks me to redo parts of my recording.</p>

<p>Finally I convert the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polished</code> AUP file to an MP3 file. I rename the MP3 to fit LibriVox’s naming conventions and then upload it for proof listening.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a proof listener asks me to make changes to the recording, I go back to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">working</code> file to make my fixes and proceed from there. This helps ensure that any newly recorded sections fit seamlessly with the rest.</p>
